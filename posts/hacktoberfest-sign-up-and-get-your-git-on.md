Itâ€™s October, which means pumpkins, candy, costumes, and Hacktoberfest ðŸŽƒ If you are completely new to open source and
contributing on Github, but want to join in the fun, read on. This is the first in a series of posts I will write
everyday to help newcomers get the most out of Hacktoberfest. So let us start the journey.

## Get your Github Account

The first task in your contribution journey is going to be signing up on Github. Itâ€™s completely free, and itâ€™s the
largest community on the web of people building open source software. Itâ€™s also where all the Hacktoberfest action
happens.

So [head over to Github](https://github.com/), and sign up for your account. When youâ€™re done, come back here and
continue the journey.

## Installing Git

Part two of your contribution journey is installing Git. In short, Git is distributed source control software that makes
collaborating on projects a breeze. For more detail, head over to the Git-SCM website.

If you are on a Linux system, you can install Git one of two ways:

<pre><code class="bash">$ sudo dnf install git-all</code></pre>

Or on a Debian based flavour such as Ubuntu:

<pre><code class="bash">$ sudo apt install git-all</code></pre>

For a complete list of Linux [installation options head over to the Linux page](https://git-scm.com/download/linux) on
the Git website.

On MacOS and Windows, the quickest way is simply [installing Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). Not only does
this give you a graphical user interface into Git and Github itself, it also:

- Brings along a command line version of Git if the command line is more your style
- Works well with [Powershell](https://github.com/powershell/powershell)
- Sets up solid credential caching
- And sane [CRLF
  settings](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1552749/difference-between-cr-lf-lf-and-cr-line-break-types)
- That is a long way of saying, itâ€™s pretty dang sweet ;p

You can of course install Git by itself without Github Desktop. To do that, head over to the [Git website and download
an installer](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for your operating system.

## Sign up for Hacktoberfest

With all of the above done, you are now ready to sign up for Hacktoberfest. DigitalOcean has made it super simple. Head
over to the [Hacktoberfest website](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/), click on the Sign Up link, and sign up
using the Github account you created earlier.

Thatâ€™s it! You are ready to start contributing to open source, help out project maintainers, gain some new skills, and
get a t-shirt for your work. That is a pretty neat deal I reckon.

Oh, and come back tomorrow for the next instalment of this series where we will talk forking, cloning, branching and
pull requests. In the mean time, go [find a project](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/#projects), or a specific
[issue](https://github.com/search?q=label:hacktoberfest+state:open+type:issue) you would love to contribute to, and make
your intent known by adding a comment to the issue.
