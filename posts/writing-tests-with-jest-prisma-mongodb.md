When writing an API it is critical to have a test suite that puts your API through the same scenarios as that of a user of the API. This ensures that:

- All API functions return data in the format the user would expect.
- That the API returns an appropriate response when the response fails or, the user has passed invalid data.
- Can easily be run during development and as part of your continuous integration process.
- Help identify bugs and avoid regressions.
- Provide peace of mind to the author and user when making changes, or improvements to the API.

In this post I will cover the basics of setting up [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) with a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and [Prisma based API](https://www.prisma.io/) and writing a test for an API endpoint.

## Getting started

If you are reading this I am making an assumption that you have a working knowledge of using Nodejs, JavaScript, MongoDB, and Prisma. I also do not want to restate what is already in the getting started docs for Jest so, I will simply point you to the [Jest docs](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started) for getting started.

> Note: If you are using Typescript to write your API, you will also need [`ts-jest](https://kulshekhar.github.io/ts-jest/docs/getting-started/installation). Also take special note of generating a [Jest config file using `ts-jest`](https://kulshekhar.github.io/ts-jest/docs/getting-started/installation#jest-config-file).
> NOTE: ESM: If you are using EcmaScript Modules there is some more configuration needed as [ESM support in Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/ecmascript-modules) is still exprimental. There is also some additional configuration needed for [`ts-jest` to work with ESM](https://kulshekhar.github.io/ts-jest/docs/guides/esm-support).

### Sidenote

If you are using both Typescript and ESM, I am going to save you some time here. Here is the configuration I use that I can attest works.

First you will need to have a `jest.config.ts` file with the following contents:

```ts
import type { Config } from "@jest/types";

const config: Config.InitialOptions = {
  preset: "ts-jest/presets/default-esm",
  globals: {
    "ts-jest": {
      useESM: true,
    },
  },
  moduleNameMapper: {
    "^(\\.{1,2}/.*)\\.js$": "$1",
  },
};

export default config;
```

Next you will need a `tsconfig.json` with the following:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "module": "ES2020",
    "moduleResolution": "NodeNext"
  }
}
```

In `package.json` call Jest as documented in the [Jest docs](https://jestjs.io/docs/ecmascript-modules):

```json
"test": "NODE_OPTIONS=--experimental-vm-modules npx jest"
```

If you are _not_ using TypeScript but as using ES modules, the configuration is very similar for Jest, but there is a small gotacha to be aware off. First you will need to call Jest the same way in `package.json` and you would not need a `tsconfig` file.

If your Jest configuration file uses the `.js` extension you _need_ to use the following syntax and _not_ the `module.exports` syntax:

```js
const config = {
  preset: "ts-jest/presets/default-esm",
  globals: {
    "ts-jest": {
      useESM: true,
    },
  },
  moduleNameMapper: {
    "^(\\.{1,2}/.*)\\.js$": "$1",
  },
};

export default config;
```

This is the exact same code as with TypeScript but, without the type information. You _can_ type the above using JSDoc comments as follows:

```js
/** @type {import('@jest/types').Config.InitialOptions} */
const config = {
  verbose: true,
};
```

This is completely optional and not needed to get Jest to work with ESM. If you for any reason _need_ to use the `module.exports` syntax, you will either need to [configure Jest via `package.json`](https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration) or name your file using the `.cjs` file extension. Using the `.cjs` will tell the system to treat this specific file as commonJS.

### Writing tests

Alrighty, with all of that out of the way, we can write some tests. Letâ€™s start with the most basic test as used by the Jest documentation. Here we are simply verifying that everything does indeed work. Create a file caled `index.ts`(I a using TypeScript here but feel free to stick with `.js` and JavaScript):

```ts
export function sum(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a + b;
}
```

Next, create your test file. We will use the common naming scheme: `index.test.ts`:

```ts
import { sum } from "./index.js";

test("adds 1 + 2 to equal 3", () => {
  expect(sum(1, 2)).toBe(3);
});
```

If you have set up your `test` target in `package.json` as discussed earlier you can now run your test with, `npm test`. If all is right with the world, you should end up with a successful test run.

## Testing our Prisma API

I am not going to work directly with MongoDB here but through Prisma as mentioned at the start of the post. I will the set up that worked for me here, but you can also [reference the same Prisma docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/testing/unit-testing) I used for additional details.

We need to update our Jest configuration a little bit.

```ts
const config = {
  preset: "ts-jest/presets/default-esm",
  clearMocks: true,
  globals: {
    "ts-jest": {
      useESM: true,
    },
  },
  moduleNameMapper: {
    "^(\\.{1,2}/.*)\\.js$": "$1",
  },
  setupFilesAfterEnv: ["./singleton.ts"],
};

export default config;
```

The additions are `clearMocks` and `setupFilesAfterEnv`. The Prisma docs explains the need for `setupFilesAfterEnv` as follows:

> The module the path points towards is the code that runs setting up the testing framework before each test file is executed.

Setting [`clearMocks` to true](https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration#clearmocks-boolean) is "equivalent to calling `jest.clearAllMocks()` before each test". We also need to pass the `-i` flag, which is an [alias for the `--runInBand` flag](https://jestjs.io/docs/cli#--runinband), to Jest when calling it. This ensures that tests are run serially in the current process instead of using a worker pool. This can lead to your tests running slower, but according to the Prisma docs it is needed to avoid [race conditions](https://techterms.com/definition/race_condition).

There are [two approaches mentioned in the Prisma docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/testing/unit-testing#mocking-the-prisma-client) for mocking our client when unit testing. The one uses a singleton pattern and the other dependency injection. Both are valid and have their pros and cons. I will here be using the [singleton pattern](https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/testing/unit-testing#singleton).

The first thing we want to do is intall the [Jest mock extended](https://github.com/marchaos/jest-mock-extended) package.

```bash
npm install jest-mock-extended --save-dev
```

If you do not already have a Prisma client file, create a file called `client.ts` at the root of your project with the following contents:

```ts
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";

const prisma = new PrismaClient();

export default prisma;
```

You can type out or copy and paste the code for the singleton from the [Prisma docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/testing/unit-testing#singleton). I recommend typing it out as a means of getting familiar with the code.
