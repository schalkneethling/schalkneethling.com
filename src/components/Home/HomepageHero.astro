  <h1>Building for the web platform, not around it</h1>
  
  <p>I'm Schalk Neethling, and I build for the web platform. That means starting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, leaning into what the platform gives us before reaching for frameworks. But I'm not dogmatic. When the platform doesn't solve the problem, I use the tool that does.</p>

  <p>Above all, I write code that future developers (including future me) can trust. That means semantic markup, explicit types, validated data, and clear intent over clever shortcuts.</p>

  <p>I have complicated feelings about AI. I'm concerned about how it's trained, deployed, and often wasted as entertainment. But I also use it daily in my engineering work because it's genuinely empowering. It helps me learn faster and dive deeper into the things I actually care about.</p>

  <p>Here's my rule: if I'm using AI, I have to expect more from myself. I have to build software that's demonstrably better in accessibility, performance, and maintainability. Technology is only as good as what we choose to do with it.</p>

  <p>Currently: Senior frontend engineer at <a href="https://factorial.io">Factorial.io</a> • Writing <a href="https://schalkneethling.github.io/html-comprehensive-guide/">HTML: A Comprehensive Guide</a></p>
