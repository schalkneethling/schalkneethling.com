The native `<dialog>` element was a huge step forward for web developers. It gave us a standardized way to create modal dialogs with built-in backdrop handling, focus management, and keyboard interactions—no more reinventing the wheel with `div` containers and mountains of JavaScript.

But we still needed JavaScript for one fundamental task: opening the dialog.

The HTML Invoker Commands API changes that. Now you can create fully functional dialogs with just HTML.

## The Traditional Approach

Here's what we typically had to write:

```html
<button type="button" id="openBtn">Open Dialog</button>
<dialog id="dialog">
  <form method="dialog">
    <button type="submit">Close Dialog</button>
  </form>
  <!-- dialog content -->
</dialog>

<script>
  const dialog = document.getElementById('dialog');
  const openBtn = document.getElementById('openBtn');
  
  openBtn.addEventListener('click', () => {
    dialog.showModal();
  });
</script>
```

You could close the dialog without JavaScript using `<form method="dialog">`, but you still needed JavaScript to open it.

## The Invoker Commands Approach

With Invoker Commands, you add two attributes to your button:

```html
<button commandfor="dialog" command="show-modal" type="button">
  Open Dialog
</button>

<dialog id="dialog">
  <button commandfor="dialog" command="close" type="button">
    Close Dialog
  </button>
  <!-- dialog content -->
</dialog>
```

That's it. No JavaScript required.

## How It Works

The two key attributes are:

- **`commandfor`**: References the `id` of the element you want to control
- **`command`**: Specifies what action to perform

For dialogs, you have two command options:

- `show-modal`: Opens the dialog as a modal (with backdrop, blocking interaction with the rest of the page)
- `close`: Closes the dialog

## What You Get for Free

When you use `command="show-modal"`, the browser handles:

- Opening the dialog in the top layer (above all other content)
- Adding a backdrop that blocks interaction with the page
- Moving focus into the dialog
- Closing with the <kbd>Esc</kbd> key
- Managing the accessibility tree

## Browser Support

<BaselineStatus id="invoker-commands" />

Invoker Commands are now supported across all modern browsers. This is still a rather new addition to the platform so, you will have to determine whether it is safe to use in your production environment. With that said, there is also a [polyfill available](https://github.com/keithamus/invokers-polyfill) by [Keith Cirkel](https://github.com/keithamus).

> NOTE: The Invoker Commands API is supported by all modern browsers. See the [browser compatibility table on MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Invoker_Commands_API#browser_compatibility) for details.

## Why This Matters

Invoker Commands represent a broader shift: giving HTML the power to handle common interactive patterns without requiring JavaScript. This means:

- Faster initial page loads (less JavaScript to parse and execute)
- More resilient interfaces (works even if JavaScript fails to load)
- Simpler codebases (less glue code to maintain)
- Better alignment with the declarative nature of HTML

The web platform keeps getting better at being the web platform.
