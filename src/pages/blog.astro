      My writing on this website will span many different topics, ranging from
      web standards, tutorials, mental health, thoughts and ideas, and general
      musings. While the bulk of my writing will be technical in nature it will
      vary from long form to short form and sometimes include video and audio.
      Some content will be beginner-friendly, while other pieces will be geared
      towards those who have been building for the web for some time.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the last point, please note that I might occasionally misjudge the
      experience level required for certain content. If you find something where
      you believe I've got it wrong, <a
        href="https://github.com/schalkneethling/schalkneethling.com/issues"
        >please let me know on GitHub</a
      >, and I would be happy to correct it.
    </p>
    <p>
      To help you find the content you're interested in, I offer different ways
      to browse my writing. Below, you'll find a list of tags to filter content
      by topic. Additionally, all my writing is listed chronologically, allowing
      you to scroll through or use your browser's find-in-page functionality to
      locate something specific.
    </p>
    <p>
      As with most things, this website will evolve and improve over time based
      on the time I have to work on it and your feedback and suggestions.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the first features I want to add is the ability to search for
      content across the blog. I believe a well-implemented search feature is
      one of the most powerful navigational tools, enhancing usability and
      accessibility. I plan to experiment with different implementations, and
      once available, I would appreciate your feedback on the search results to
      ensure the best possible experience.
    </p>
    <p>I hope you find value in the writing you discover here.</p>
