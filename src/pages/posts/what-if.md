```bash
You stopped worrying about what others think?
You did something that made you happy?
You loved unconditionally?
You cared deeply?
You assumed good intent until proven differently?
You reinvented the wheel?
You left judgement at the door?
You finally exhaled?
You embraced change?
You asked for forgiveness instead of permission?
You did not fear that or those who are different?
You had no strong opinions?
You forgave yourself?
You forgave?
You celebrated diverse opinions?
You did not always have to be right?
You said, I am sorry?
You did not leave that comment?
You did not care about the views?
You used the tools you know?
You gave someone a hug?
You allowed someone to hug you?
You allowed yourself to feel?
You allowed yourself to cry?
You said, thank you?
You put down that burden you have been carrying?
You stood up tall?
You stood still for a moment?
Your struggle was real and valid?

You write that book?
You published that article?
You took that photo?
You published that video?
You wrote the code?
You learned a new hobby just because?
You admitted that you do not know?
You stood up for yourself?
You stood up for someone else?
You made your art?

What if...

You accepted yourself for who you are, without judgement,
   without holding back, without apologizing for being alive,
        but instead, you decided to deliberately live out loud?
```
